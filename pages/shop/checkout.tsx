// useEffect: is a hook that allows you to invoke a function when the component loads
// useMemo: allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization>

    // ## Notes â¬‡â¬‡
    // The wallet makes 2 requests to our URL (contd. below)
    // i) In the first request, it sends a GET request, and we can return some data identifying ourselves.
    // The wallet can display this to the user, so they understand who theyâ€™re transacting with.
    // ii) In the second it sends a POST request with the public key of the buyer, and we return our transaction and message.
    // See: <https://i.imgur.com/fWVlKks.png>

    // ##
    // An important and powerful feature here, is that the 'account' is sent to our API when the transaction is requested
    // We can do things like â¬‡
    // 1) Look at the user/buyerâ€™s balances or tokens on the blockchain
    // 2) Or their transaction history, and return a different transaction depending on who the buyer is
    // 3) Maybe we want holders of a certain NFT to get a discount?
    // 4) Maybe we want to give new customers (who have shopped elsewhere previously) some coupons?

    // NB:
    // Knowing the buyerâ€™s wallet address (public key) gives us a huge amount of flexibility!
    // And with transaction requests, we can do all of this for IRL payments, as well as on our dApp (site)

    // ##

    // Our API already does the most complicated part of transaction requests: returning a serialized transaction
    // But we need to extend it to handle the GET requests (Ref. to '/pages/api/makeTransaction.ts' file)
    // The specification expects us to to a GET request with â¬‡â¬‡
